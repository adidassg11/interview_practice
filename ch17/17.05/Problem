Problem 17.5

The Game of MasterMind is played as follow:
The cpu has 4 slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow(Y), green(G), or blue(B). For example, the cpu might have RGGB (slot #1 is red, slots 2 and 3 are green, etc)

You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess YRGB.

when you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a 'hit'. If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a 'pseudo hit'. Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit.

For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one p-hit

Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of hits and p-hits.
