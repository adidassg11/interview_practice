onsider a simple node-like data structure call BiNode, which has pointers to two other nodes.

public class BiNode {
    public BiNode node1, node2;
    public int data;
}

The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree (where node1 is the left node and node2 is the right node) or a doubly linked list (where node1 is prev and node2 is next). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (impl. with binode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original data structure)
