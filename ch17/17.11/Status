COMPLETE (sort of)

progress - 
- my rand generator is obviously lopsided, getting it right will help with other problems
    - this was just a really stupid bug
- now i'm realizing you can't just use addition with rand5's  and get rand10
- SOLUTION: generate random digits (using rand5) for a large number then simply do mod7
    - caveat - rand7 given rand5 works, but other combinations don't
