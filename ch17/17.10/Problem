Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:
    Element --> Tag attributes END children END
    Attribute --> Tag value
    END --> 0
    Tag --> some predefined mapping to int
    Value --> string value END
For example, the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a mapping of family -> 1, person ->2, firstname ->3, lastname ->4, state -> 5).
    <family lastName="McDowell" state="CA">
        <person firstName="Gayle">Some message</person>
    </family>
Becomes:
    1 4 McDowell 5 CA 0 2 3 Gayle 0 Some message 0 0.

Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element (passed in Element and Attribute objects)
