6.6 DELETE DUPLICATES FROM A SORTED ARRAY
4 This problem is concerned with deleting repeated elements from a sorted ar-
ray. For example, if A = (2, 3, 5,5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 13), then after deletion, A
(2, 3, 5, 7,11,13, 0, 0, 0). After deletion, there are 6 valid entries in A. There are
no requirements as to the values stored beyond the last valid element.
Problem 6.6: Write a function which takes as input a sorted array A and updates
A so that all duplicates have been removed and the remaining elements have been
shifted left to fill the emptied indices. Return the number of valid elements in A.
Many languages have library functions for performing this operation-you cannot
use these functions. (Imagine you are implementing the corresponding library.)
