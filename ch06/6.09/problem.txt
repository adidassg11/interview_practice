6.9 GENERALIZATIONS OF MAX DIFFERENCE 
One interpretation of the max difference problem, introduced on Page 2, is that it formalizes the max profit that can be made by buying and then selling a single share over a given day range. It naturally generalizes to the following 3 problems. For each problem, a bu-sell transaction must be completed before the next can be initiated. 

Problem 6.9: For each of the following, A is an integer array of length n. (1.) What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share two times over a given day range? (2.) What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share k times over a given day range?  Here k is a fixed input pa share (3.) What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling share any number of times over a given day range?
