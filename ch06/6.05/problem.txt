6 5 DELETE A KEY FROM AN ARRAY
This problem is concerned with writing a remove function for arrays. Often lan-
guages have library functions for performing this operation. You cannot use these
functions. (Imagine you are implementing the corresponding library.)
Problem 6.5: Implement a function which takes as input an array A of integers and
an integer k, and updates A so that all occurrences of k have been removed and the
remaining elements have been shifted left to fill the emptied indices. Return the
f number of remaining elements. There are no requirements as to the values stored
beyond the last valid element. For example, if A = (5, 3, 7, 11, 2, 3, 13, 5, 7) and k = 3,
then (5,7, 11,2, 13,5, 7,0,0) is an acceptable update to A, and the return value is 7.
