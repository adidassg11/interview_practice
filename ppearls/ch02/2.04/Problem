Several readers pointed out that while all 3 rotation algos require time proportional to n, the juggling algorithm is apparently twice as fast as the reversal algo: it stores and retrieves each element of the array just once, while the reversal algo does so twice. Experiment with the functions to compare their speeds on real machines; be especially sensitive to issues surrounding the locality of memory references.
