4.8
you have two very large bin trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and G2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algo to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.

A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2, that is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees should be identical.
