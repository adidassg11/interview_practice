3.3
imagine a literal stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple, therefore in real life we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implmement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to single stack equivalents.

FOLLOW UP
implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
