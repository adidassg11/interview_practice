An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly FIFO basis. People must adopt either the oldest (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). they cannot select which specifica animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. you may use the built-in LinkedList data structure
