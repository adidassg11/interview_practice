/*
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. 

EXAMPLE
input: 7>1>6 + 5>9>2, that is, 617 + 296
output: 2>1>9, that is, 912

FOLLOW UP
suppose these digits are stored in forward order. repeat the problem above

EXAMPLE
input: 5>1>7 + 2>9>5, that is 617+295
output 9>1>2, that is 912
