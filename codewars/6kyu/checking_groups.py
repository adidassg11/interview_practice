In English and programming, groups can be made using symbols such as "()" and "{}" that change meaning. However, these groups must be closed in the correct order to maintain correct syntax.

Your job in this kata will be to make a program that checks a string for correct grouping. For instance, the following groups are done correctly:

({})
[[]()]
[{()}]

The next are done incorrectly

{(})
([]
[])
