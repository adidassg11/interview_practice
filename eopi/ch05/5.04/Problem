5.04 Find a closest int with the same weight
White ninja

Define the weight of a nonnegative int x to be the number of bits that are set to 1 in its binary representation. For example, since 92 in base-2 equals (1011100), the weight of 92 is 4

Write a function which takes an unsigned 54 bit int x and returns y != x such that y has the same weight as x, and the difference of x and y is as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or all 1s, ie.e 2^64-1
